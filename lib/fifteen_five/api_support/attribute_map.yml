# Map of attribute names returned by the 15Five API to a format that Her
# expects.
#
# The 15Five API is inconsistent in how it describes attributes and
# associations.
#
# Examples:
#   - Report `reviewed_by` instead of `reviewer` or `reviewer_id`
#   - High Five has `creator_id` (Integer), Answer has `user` (which is a URL)
#
# Due to the inconsistency, we use this map to translate the API response
# into key names that are consistent and friendly for interpretation by Her.
#
# Note: this map *does not* intend to capture every attribute key returned by
# the API. Instead, it only includes the keys that need to be translated.
